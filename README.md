# ðŸ§­ Safari History Explorer
This single page tool allows you to convert Safari history JSON files exported from Safari on an iPad to a more human readable table or CSV format.

**âš  WARNING:** This tool does not include robust error handling or sanitisation of data input. You should only select a file that is a valid Safari History JSON file from a known/trusted source. If an invalid file is selected the page likely won't load properly and could cause other issues.

See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/importing-data-exported-from-safari#Understand-JSON-metadata for details of the JSON file structure.

Future versions will include the ability to save a PDF report of the converted data.

This page is mostly self contained. You can run it locally (even without an internet connection) by downloading the latest version of she.html from this repository. Note that when running it locally with no internet connection, some UI elements may look slightly different and the ability to download a PDF report may not work.
